> Automate as much as possible so you can easily get fresh data

1. List the data you need and how much you need.
2. Find and document where you can get the data
3. Check ho much space it will take
4. Check legal obligations, and get authorization if necessary
5. Get access authorizations
6. Create a workspace (with enough storage space).
7. Get the data
8. Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself)
9. Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g. anonymized).
10. Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.).
11. Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it (no data snooping!)

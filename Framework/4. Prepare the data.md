Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms


> [!NOTE] Notes
>- Work on copies of the data (keep the original dataset intact)
>- Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for five reasons:
>	- So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset
>	- So you can apply these transformations in future projects
>	- To clean and prepare new data instance once your solution is live To make it easy to treat you preparations choices as hyperparameters

1. Data cleaning:
	1. Fix or remove outliers (optional)
	2. Fill in missing values (e.g. with zero, mean, median...) or drop their rows (or columns)
2. Future selection (optional)
	1. Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task
3. Feature engineering, where appropriate:
	1. Discretize continuous features
	2. Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.)
	3. Add promising transformations of features (e.g. $x^2$, $log(x)$, $\sqrt[2]{x}$, etc)
	4. Aggregate features into promising new features
4. Feature scaling: standardize or normalize features

Frame the problem and look at the big picture

1. Define the objective in business terms
2. How will your solution be used?
3. What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?
4. How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offile, etc)?
5. How should performance be measured?
6. Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?
7. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?
8. What are comparable problems? can you reuse experience or tools?
9. Is human expertise available?
10. Verify assumptions if possible

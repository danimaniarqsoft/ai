Explore the data to gain insights


> [!NOTE] Note
> Try to get insights from a field expert for these steps.

1. Create a copy of the data for exploration (sampling it down to a manageable size if necessary)
2. Create a Jupyter notebook to keep a record o your data exploration
3. Study each attribute and its characteristics:
	1. Name
	2. Type (categorical, int/float, bounded/unbounded, text, structured, etc.)
	3. % of missing values
	4. Noisiness and type of noise (stochastic, outliers, rounding errors, etc.)
	5. Possibly useful for the task?
	6. Type of distribution (Gaussian, uniform, logarithmic, etc)
4. For supervised learning task, identify the target attributes(s)
5. Visualize the data
6. Study the correlation between attributes
7. Study how you would solve the problem manually.
8. Identify the promising transformations you may want to apply.
9. Identify extra data that would be useful (go back to "Get the Data")
10. Document what you have learned

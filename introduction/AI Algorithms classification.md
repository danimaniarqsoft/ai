There are many ways to classify AI algorithms, some of them area:

1. Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, reinforcement learning
2. Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly online versus batch learning
3. Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points or instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model (instance based, model based)

> [!note] Instance base
> Models learn from examples and makes predictions by finding similar examples in the training data


> [!note] Model Base
> Models learn the underlying relationships and patterns in the data by creating a mathematical representation



## Supervised learning

- The training data includes the desired solution. 
- The training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired soluctions, called **labels**.
- A typical supervised learning task is classification
- Other typical task is to predict a target numeric value given a set of **features** called **predictors**. This sort of task is called **regression**.

Classification: The training data has a class
